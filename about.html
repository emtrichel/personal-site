    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Eric, and I’ve had quite a journey so far. Let me share a bit about myself:</p>
    <h2>Military Service</h2>
    <p>At the age of 18, fresh out of high school, I made a pivotal decision: to join the Marine Corps. Over the next 8 years, I dedicated myself to service, rising through the ranks to become a Sergeant. As a squad leader in multiple infantry units, I learned the true meaning of teamwork, discipline, and unwavering commitment.</p>
    <h2>Transitioning to Civilian Life</h2>
    <p>When my military service concluded, I found myself in the civilian world. Construction became my new path, but life had other plans. After losing my job, I faced a crossroads. It was then that I realized my true passion lay elsewhere—within the realm of computers.</p>
    <h2>Embracing Coding</h2>
    <p>One morning, fueled by determination, I decided to embark on a new adventure. Armed with curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I began teaching myself how to code. The world of programming opened up before me, and I eagerly absorbed every concept, language, and algorithm.</p>
    <h2>Crafting Websites from Scratch</h2>
    <p>Currently, I’m knee-deep in my second “from scratch” website. It’s not just lines of code; it’s my canvas—a place where creativity meets functionality. On this site, you’ll find a collection of my work, a testament to my evolving skills and dedication.</p>
    <h1>Curious Bytes: A Blog</h1>
    <p>Curious Bytes is where I share my journey of self-teaching, technology, space exploration, scientific discoveries, and anything else that piques my interest. Whether it’s unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos or exploring the intricacies of a new programming language, I document it all.</p>

    <li>Everyday Musings: Sometimes, it’s the little things—the cup of coffee, a sunrise, or a random thought—that spark inspiration. I’ll share those too.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Long-Term Aspirations</h2>
    <p>My ultimate goal? To become a software engineer. I envision myself contributing to innovative projects, solving complex problems, and shaping the digital landscape. The thrill of creating elegant solutions drives me forward.</p>
    <h2>Short-Term Focus</h2>
    <p>But I’m not waiting for the distant future. My short-term focus is crystal clear: I want to build websites for others. Collaborating with clients who have a vision, helping them bring it to life, and learning alongside them—that’s where my heart lies.</p>
    <p>So, whether you’re a fellow learner, a visionary entrepreneur, or someone seeking a web presence, let’s connect. Together, we’ll turn ideas into reality, one line of code at a time.
    Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey!</p>
